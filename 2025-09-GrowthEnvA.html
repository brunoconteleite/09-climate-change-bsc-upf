# Trade, Growth, and the Environment: Intro

- We previouly studied the failures in markets and economy that lead to negative environmental outcome

- We have also investigated the tools to address these failures

  - And the &lt;r&gt;environmental policies&lt;/r&gt; aiming at that goal
  
- We have also seen that progress on environmental outcomes were &lt;r&gt;below expected&lt;/r&gt; in the past decades

`\(\text{ }\)`

&lt;u&gt;This week:&lt;/u&gt; how &lt;r&gt;economic growth and trade liberalization&lt;/r&gt; interact with

  - Stringency and performance of environmental policies?
  
  - Resulting environmental outcomes?

# Trade, Growth, and the Environment: Intro

The questions we are interested at are:

1. Is there a systematic relationship between economic growth and environmental quality?

  - Environmental Kuznets Curve

2. What are the sources of environmental quality changes?

  - Scale, Composition, and Techinique Effects

3. What explains differences in growth-environment paths across the world?

  - Structural change and/or globalization?

# Part 1: Growth, the Environment, and 

# the Environmental Kuznets Curve

---

# Trade, Growth, and the Environment: Kuznets Curve

- How does economic growth relate to environmental outcomes?

- Is there a &lt;r&gt;tradeoff&lt;/r&gt; between economic growth and environmental resources?

- &lt;u&gt;Important questions&lt;/u&gt;: policies for growth `\(\leftrightarrow\)` environmental quality

- &lt;u&gt;Difficult questions&lt;/u&gt;: countries differ in many dimensions (e.g., institutional quality, preferences for the environmental preservation)

  - Each country faces different constrains &lt;r&gt;as it evolves over time&lt;/r&gt;
  
---

# Trade, Growth, and the Environment: Kuznets Curve

In the early 1990s, Grossman and Krueger (GK) hypothesized

&gt; *"Economic growth brings an initial phase of environmental deterioration followed by a subsequent phase of improvement."*

- Two-phase process: &lt;r&gt;inverted U-shaped relationship&lt;/r&gt; between income per capita and environmental quality in a country

- Such a relationship is referred to in the literature as the "*Environmental Kuznets Curve*" (EKC)

- &lt;u&gt;Inspiration&lt;/u&gt;: original Kuznets curve between income per capita and inequality

---

# Trade, Growth, and the Environment: Kuznets Curve

How does that look in 1990s? Grossman and Krueger's results:

---

# Trade, Growth, and the Environment: EKC

Why would the EKC feature a inverse-U shape? &lt;u&gt;Four explanations&lt;/u&gt;:

--

- &lt;u&gt;Sources of growth&lt;/u&gt;: e.g., between capital and human capital

  - Example: manufacturing- to service-based economy
  
  - Shift from carbon intense industry is unrelated to environmental policy
  
  - Related to process of &lt;r&gt;structural change&lt;/r&gt; (i.e., modernization of the economy)

---

# Trade, Growth, and the Environment: EKC

Why would the EKC feature a inverse-U shape? &lt;u&gt;Four explanations&lt;/u&gt;:

- &lt;u&gt;Income effects&lt;/u&gt;: wealth increase `\(\rightarrow\)` higher demand for environmental quality

  - Unrelated to structural change (i.e. changes in sectoral composition of the economy)
  
  - Related to &lt;r&gt;institutional changes&lt;/r&gt; that respond to income and development
  
---

# Trade, Growth, and the Environment: EKC

Why would the EKC feature a inverse-U shape? &lt;u&gt;Four explanations&lt;/u&gt;:

- &lt;u&gt;Threshold effects&lt;/u&gt;: abatement (environmental) policies are too costly (e.g., resources, political capital)

  - Not worth abating emissions &lt;r&gt;up to a certain level&lt;/r&gt; (threshold) of pollution
  
  - Equivalent to a sunk cost of abatement (e.g., setting environmental agencies)
  
- &lt;u&gt;Inreasing returns to abatement&lt;/u&gt;: similar idea; it gets easier to abate &lt;r&gt;as scale increases&lt;/r&gt; (e.g., recycling)

---

# Trade, Growth, and the Environment: EKC

Since GK, the empirical relevance of the EKC has been widely studied. &lt;u&gt;Main limitations&lt;/u&gt;:

- There are many &lt;r&gt;different indicators&lt;/r&gt; of environmental quality

  - Not all pollutants are subject to the same mechanisms behind EKC

- Countries are different, and may over time experience different economic and environmental constrains

  - Hard to predict when and how environmental policies get adopted

For these reasons, the empirical relevance of the EKC has remained &lt;r&gt;somehow inconclusive&lt;/r&gt;

---

# Trade, Growth, and the Environment: EKC

Moreover, EKC theory assumes that countries &lt;r&gt;modernize independently&lt;/r&gt;

But countries grow interdependently, connected by trade linkages

--

- How would the EKC results change in the current &lt;r&gt;globalized economy?&lt;/r&gt;

  - Would international trade `\(\rightarrow\)` more growth and environmental quality?

  - Or would it allow for countries to improve environmental quality &lt;r&gt;at the expense of others?&lt;/r&gt;
  
--

For that, we need to learn more about the &lt;u&gt;sources of environmental quality changes&lt;/u&gt;

# Part 2: Sources of Environmental Quality

# Scale, Composition, and Technique Effects

---

# Scale, Composition, and Technique Effects

Consider an economy with two sectors, say manufacturing and services

- Different emission-intensities; manufacturing `\(\rightarrow\)` "brown sector"

How can this economy change/reduce its emissions?

--

&lt;u&gt;Scale effect&lt;/u&gt;: changes in emission if the economy simple &lt;r&gt;"scales up"&lt;/r&gt;

- More output, more emissions

- Disregards changes in &lt;r&gt;sectoral composition&lt;/r&gt; and technology

- "De-growth" `\(\rightarrow\)` improved environmental quality

---

# Scale, Composition, and Technique Effects

&lt;u&gt;Composition effect&lt;/u&gt;: changes in emission if the economy &lt;r&gt;switches sectors&lt;/r&gt;

- Less manufacturing, more services

- Related to the "source of growth" EKC explanation

- Assumes no changes in aggregate scale and/or &lt;r&gt;technologies&lt;/r&gt;

  - What about innovation making manufacturing less polluting?

--

&lt;u&gt;Technique effect&lt;/u&gt;: changes in emission if the sectors become &lt;r&gt;less emission-intense&lt;/r&gt;

- Allow for composition and scale to remain constant

- Driven purely by technological innovation!

---

# Scale, Composition, and Technique Effects

In reality, all effects should be in place &lt;r&gt;at the same time&lt;/r&gt;!

- How to disentagle the changes in emission per capita across countries over time?

  - Were they techinically changing, or only changing composition (i.e., outsourcing pollution)?
  
--

There is evidence for &lt;r&gt;both effects being in place&lt;/r&gt;!

- Shapiro and Walker: "*Why Is Pollution from U.S. Manufacturing Declining?*"

- Copeland and others: "*Globalization and the Environment*"

---

# Scale, Composition, and Technique Effects

The US case: manufacturing output has been increasing remarkably, but emissions decreasing

&lt;img src="figs/fig_shapiro_sct1.png" style="width: 80%" /&gt;

---

# Scale, Composition, and Technique Effects

What are the role of &lt;u&gt;scale, composition, and technique&lt;/u&gt; effects?

&lt;img src="figs/fig_shapiro_sct2.png" style="width: 80%" /&gt;

---

# Scale, Composition, and Technique Effects

What are the role of &lt;u&gt;scale, composition, and technique&lt;/u&gt; effects?

- Solid green (Scale)

  - Counterfactual emissions if emission intensities and composition of products had been fixed at 1990 levels

- Dashed red (Scale + Composition)

  - Counterfactual emissions if emission intensities had been fixed at their 1990 level

- Dotted blue (Scale + Composition + Technique)

  - Observed level of emissions where the three margins of scale, composition, and technique changed

---

# Scale, Composition, and Technique Effects

- The difference between Solid green and Dashed red:

  - &lt;r&gt;Limited composition effect&lt;/r&gt; between low- and high-emission-intensive products

- The difference Dashed red and Dotted blue:

  - &lt;u&gt;Technique effect explains&lt;/u&gt; the decline in emission intensity at the level of individual products

- &lt;u&gt;Explanation&lt;/u&gt;: increase in environmental regulation at the US from 1990s

  - But what about the rest of the World?

# Part 3: Changes in Environmental Quality

# in the Globalized Economy
  
---

# Trade, Growth, and the Environment

Does the evidence of developed economies becoming "clean" imply

- Lower environmental damanges worldwide?

- Efficient explotation of environmental resources?

Copeland and others: "*Globalization and the Environment*"

- Next: some empirical facts related to developed and developing economies

- Next class: deeper discussion and more facts

---

# Trade, Growth, and the Environment: Copeland et al. (2021)

&lt;u&gt;Fact 1&lt;/u&gt;: Most global emissions come from developing countries

&lt;img src="figs/fig_shapiro_sct3.png" style="width: 100%" /&gt;


---

# Trade, Growth, and the Environment: Copeland et al. (2021)

&lt;u&gt;Fact 2&lt;/u&gt;: International trade accounts for `\(\sim\)` 1/3 of global pollution

&lt;img src="figs/fig_shapiro_sct4.png" style="width: 100%" /&gt;

---

# Trade, Growth, and the Environment: Copeland et al. (2021)

&lt;u&gt;Fact 3&lt;/u&gt;: Rich countries are increasingly outsourcing pollution (to pollution havens)

&lt;img src="figs/fig_shapiro_sct5.png" style="width: 100%" /&gt;

---

# Trade, Growth, and the Environment: Takeaways

The evidence of developed economies &lt;r&gt;technically transitioning&lt;/r&gt; towards greener economies is limited

- Hides a process of pollution outsourcing

- To what are called &lt;r&gt;pollution havens&lt;/r&gt;

- Structural change (or composition effects) are part of the story

  - Without (global) innovation, limited scope for `\(\uparrow\)` global environmental quality
  
- Instead, developed economies might continue to import goods with high &lt;r&gt;environmental footprint&lt;/r&gt;
